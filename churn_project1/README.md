# 🚀 Excel Dashboard Project – Customer Churn Analysis

I’m excited to share my latest project where I built an **Excel Dashboard** to analyze customer behavior and churn rates.

## 📊 Key Insights from the analysis:

1️⃣ **Age Impact** → Senior customers show higher churn rates.  
2️⃣ **Contract Type** → New customers, especially those on Month-to-Month contracts, are more likely to churn compared to long-term contract customers.  
3️⃣ **Main Reason for Churn** → Most customers leave due to competitors.  
4️⃣ **Unlimited Plan + Low Usage** → Customers on unlimited data plans consuming less than 5GB per month have higher churn rates (they don’t see value for money).  
5️⃣ **Geographic Impact** → California has the highest churn rate among all states.

## 🎯 Outcome:
The dashboard provided clear visibility into the customer segments most at risk of churn, enabling better strategies for retention.  

💡 This experience reinforces that data is not just numbers… it’s a powerful tool for making strategic decisions.
